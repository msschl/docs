### Microsoft.VisualBasic.Constants.vbNewLine is obsolete

The <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Constants.vbNewLine?displayProperty=fullName> constant is marked [Obsolete](xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute) starting with .NET Core 3.0 Preview 8.

#### Version introduced

3.0 Preview 8

#### Change description

Starting with .NET Core 3.0 Preview 8, the [Obsolete](xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute) attribute has been applied to the <xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Constants.vbNewLine?displayProperty=fullName> constant. Use of the constant produces a compiler warning. In previous releases of both .NET Core and .NET Framework, it was not marked as obsolete.

This change was made to support Visual Basic as a language for multi-platform development. The `vbNewLine` constant is equivalent to `\r\n`, the newline character sequence on Windows. On Unix-based systems, the newline character is `\n`.

#### Recommended action

The [Obsolete](xref:System.ObsoleteAttribute) attribute message for `vbNewLine` includes the following recommendation:

> For a carriage return and line feed, use [vbCrLf](xref:Microsoft.VisualBasic.Constants.vbCrLf). For the current platform's newline, use <xref:System.Environment.NewLine?displayProperty=nameWithType>.
