# .NET Docs

This repository contains the conceptual documentation for .NET. The [.NET documentation site](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet) is built from multiple repositories in addition to this one:

- [Code samples and snippets](https://github.com/dotnet/samples)
- [API reference](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs)
- [.NET Compiler Platform SDK reference](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-api-docs)

Issues and tasks for all but the API reference repository are tracked here. We have a large community using these resources. We make our best effort to respond to issues in a timely fashion. You can read more about our procedures for classifying and resolving issues in our [Issues policy](issues-policy.md) topic.

We welcome contributions to help us improve and complete the .NET docs. This is a very large repo, covering a large area. If this is your first visit, see our [labels and projects roadmap](styleguide/labels-projects.md) for help navigating the issues and projects in this repository.

To contribute, see the [Projects for .NET Community Contributors](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/35) for ideas. The [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) has instructions on procedures we use. 

If you're interested in helping migrate existing code that targets the .NET Framework from [Code Gallery](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com) to .NET Core applications stored in our [samples repository](https://github.com/dotnet/samples) and downloadable from the [Samples Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse), see the [Code Gallery migration](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/projects/88) project. 

We anticipate that [Xamarin](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin), [Mono](http://docs.go-mono.com/?link=root%3a%2fclasslib) and [Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) will also use this documentation.

This project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant
to clarify expected behavior in our community.
