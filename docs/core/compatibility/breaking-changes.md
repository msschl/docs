# Breaking change selectors

The following version and area selectors provide a filtered list of applicable breaking changes between different versions of .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core. You can also browse version to version or category articles in the table of contents.

## By version

Select the .NET version that you're currently targeting and then the .NET Core version you wish to migrate to:

[!INCLUDE[versionselector](~/includes/core-changes/versionselector.md)]

> [!TIP]
> If you're migrating a Windows Forms app from .NET Framework to .NET Core, see [Breaking changes in Windows Forms (.NET Framework to .NET Core)](../porting/winforms-breaking-changes.md) instead of using the version selector.

## By area

Select the .NET Core technology area that you're interested in. Individual changes are ordered by .NET Core version.

[!INCLUDE[categoryselector](~/includes/core-changes/categoryselector.md)]

## GitHub issues and announcements

You can also view individual issues that detail the breaking changes introduced in .NET Core in the following GitHub repositories:

- For .NET Core, the [dotnet/docs](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Abreaking-change) repository.
- For ASP.NET Core, the [aspnet/Announcements](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Breaking+change%22+label%3A3.0.0) repository.
