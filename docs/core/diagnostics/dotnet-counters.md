# dotnet-counters

**This article applies to: âœ“** .NET Core 3.0 SDK and later versions

## Install dotnet-counters

To install the latest release version of the `dotnet-counters` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-counters), use the [dotnet tool install](../tools/dotnet-tool-install.md) command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
```

## Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters [-h|--help] [--version] <command>
```

## Description

`dotnet-counters` is a performance monitoring tool for ad-hoc health monitoring and first-level performance investigation. It can observe performance counter values that are published via the <xref:System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventCounter> API. For example, you can quickly monitor things like the CPU usage or the rate of exceptions being thrown in your .NET Core application to see if there's anything suspicious before diving into more serious performance investigation using `PerfView` or `dotnet-trace`.

## Options

- **`--version`**

  Displays the version of the dotnet-counters utility.

- **`-h|--help`**

  Shows command-line help.

## Commands

| Command                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------- |
| [dotnet-counters list](#dotnet-counters-list)       |
| [dotnet-counters monitor](#dotnet-counters-monitor) |

## dotnet-counters list

Displays a list of counter names and descriptions, grouped by provider.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters list [-h|--help]
```

### Example

```console
> dotnet-counters list

    Showing well-known counters only. Specific processes may support additional counters.
    System.Runtime
        cpu-usage                    Amount of time the process has utilized the CPU (ms)
        working-set                  Amount of working set used by the process (MB)
        gc-heap-size                 Total heap size reported by the GC (MB)
        gen-0-gc-count               Number of Gen 0 GCs / sec
        gen-1-gc-count               Number of Gen 1 GCs / sec
        gen-2-gc-count               Number of Gen 2 GCs / sec
        exception-count              Number of Exceptions / sec
```

## dotnet-counters monitor

Displays periodically refreshing values of selected counters.

### Synopsis

```console
dotnet-counters monitor [-h|--help] [-p|--process-id] [--refreshInterval] [counter_list]
```

### Options

- **`-p|--process-id <PID>`**

  The ID of the process to be monitored.

- **`--refresh-interval <SECONDS>`**

  The number of seconds to delay between updating the displayed counters

- **`counter_list <COUNTERS>`**

  A space separated list of counters. Counters can be specified `provider_name[:counter_name]`. If the `provider_name` is used without a qualifying `counter_name`, then all counters are shown. To discover provider and counter names, use the [dotnet-counters list](#dotnet-counters-list) command.

### Examples

- Monitor all counters from `System.Runtime` at a refresh interval of 3 seconds:

  ```console
  > dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 1902  --refresh-interval 3 System.Runtime

  Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    System.Runtime:
      CPU Usage (%)                                 24
      Working Set (MB)                            1982
      GC Heap Size (MB)                            811
      Gen 0 GC / second                             20
      Gen 1 GC / second                              4
      Gen 2 GC / second                              1
      Number of Exceptions / sec                     4
  ```

- Monitor just CPU usage and GC heap size from `System.Runtime`:

  ```console
  > dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 1902 System.Runtime[cpu-usage,gc-heap-size]

  Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
    System.Runtime:
      CPU Usage (%)                                 24
      GC Heap Size (MB)                            811
  ```

- Monitor `EventCounter` values from user-defined `EventSource`. For more information, see [Tutorial: How to measure performance for very frequent events using EventCounters](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Diagnostics.Tracing/documentation/EventCounterTutorial.md).

  ```console
  > dotnet-counters monitor --process-id 1902 Samples-EventCounterDemos-Minimal

  Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
      request                                      100
  ```
