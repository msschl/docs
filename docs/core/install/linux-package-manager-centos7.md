# CentOS 7 Package Manager - Install .NET Core

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-switcher](./includes/package-manager-switcher.md)]

This article describes how to use a package manager to install .NET Core on CentOS 7. If you're installing the runtime, we suggest you install the [ASP.NET Core runtime](#install-the-aspnet-core-runtime), as it includes both .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

## Register Microsoft key and feed

Before installing .NET, you'll need to:

- Register the Microsoft key
- register the product repository
- Install required dependencies

This only needs to be done once per machine.

Open a terminal and run the following command.

```bash
sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm
```

## Install the .NET Core SDK

Update the products available for installation, then install the .NET Core SDK. In your terminal, run the following command.

```bash
sudo yum install dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

## Install the ASP.NET Core runtime

Update the products available for installation, then install the ASP.NET runtime. In your terminal, run the following command.

```bash
sudo yum install aspnetcore-runtime-3.1
```

## Install the .NET Core runtime

Update the products available for installation, then install the .NET Core runtime. In your terminal, run the following command.

```bash
sudo yum install dotnet-runtime-3.1
```
