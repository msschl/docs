# Debian 9 Package Manager - Install .NET Core

[!INCLUDE [package-manager-switcher](./includes/package-manager-switcher.md)]

This article describes how to use a package manager to install .NET Core on Debian 9. If you're installing the runtime, we suggest you install the [ASP.NET Core runtime](#install-the-aspnet-core-runtime), as it includes both .NET Core and ASP.NET Core runtimes.

## Register Microsoft key and feed

Before installing .NET, you'll need to:

- Register the Microsoft key
- register the product repository
- Install required dependencies

This only needs to be done once per machine.

Open a terminal and run the following commands.

```bash
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo mv microsoft.asc.gpg /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/config/debian/9/prod.list
sudo mv prod.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc.gpg
sudo chown root:root /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft-prod.list
```

## Install the .NET Core SDK

Update the products available for installation, then install the .NET Core SDK. In your terminal, run the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-3.1
```

## Install the ASP.NET Core runtime

Update the products available for installation, then install the ASP.NET runtime. In your terminal, run the following commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install aspnetcore-runtime-3.1
```
