# Scaling cloud-native applications

[!INCLUDE [book-preview](../../../includes/book-preview.md)]

One of the most-often touted advantages of moving to a cloud hosting environment is scalability. Scalability, or the ability for an application to accept additional user load without unduly degrading performance for each user, is most often achieved by breaking up applications into small pieces that can each be given whatever resources they require. In this chapter, we introduce the technologies that enable cloud-native applications to scale to meet user demand. These technologies include:

- Containers
- Orchestrators
- Serverless computing
