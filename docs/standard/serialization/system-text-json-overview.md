# JSON serialization in .NET - overview

The `System.Text.Json` namespace provides functionality for serializing to and deserializing from JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

The library design emphasizes high performance and low memory allocation over an extensive feature set. Built-in UTF-8 support optimizes the process of reading and writing JSON text encoded as UTF-8, which is the most prevalent encoding for data on the web and files on disk.

The library also provides classes for working with an in-memory document object model (DOM). This feature enables random read-only access of the elements in a JSON file or string. 

## How to get the library

* The library is built-in as part of the [.NET Core 3.0](https://aka.ms/netcore3download) shared framework.
* For other target frameworks, install the [System.Text.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Text.Json) NuGet package. The package supports:
  * .NET Standard 2.0 and later versions
  * .NET Framework 4.6.1 and later versions
  * .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2
