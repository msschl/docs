# Indices and ranges

Ranges and indices provide a succinct syntax for accessing single elements or ranges in a sequence.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

## Language support for indices and ranges

This language support relies on two new types and two new operators:

- <xref:System.Index?displayProperty=nameWithType> represents an index into a sequence.
- The index from end operator `^`, which specifies that an index is relative to the end of a sequence.
- <xref:System.Range?displayProperty=nameWithType> represents a sub range of a sequence.
- The range operator `..`, which specifies the start and end of a range as its operands.

Let's start with the rules for indices. Consider an array `sequence`. The `0` index is the same as `sequence[0]`. The `^0` index is the same as `sequence[sequence.Length]`. Note that `sequence[^0]` does throw an exception, just as `sequence[sequence.Length]` does. For any number `n`, the index `^n` is the same as `sequence[sequence.Length - n]`.

```csharp
string[] words = new string[]
{
                // index from start    index from end
    "The",      // 0                   ^9
    "quick",    // 1                   ^8
    "brown",    // 2                   ^7
    "fox",      // 3                   ^6
    "jumped",   // 4                   ^5
    "over",     // 5                   ^4
    "the",      // 6                   ^3
    "lazy",     // 7                   ^2
    "dog"       // 8                   ^1
};              // 9 (or words.Length) ^0
```

You can retrieve the last word with the `^1` index. Add the following code below the initialization:

[!code-csharp[LastIndex](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_LastIndex)]

A range specifies the *start* and *end* of a range. Ranges are exclusive, meaning the *end* is not included in the range. The range `[0..^0]` represents the entire range, just as `[0..sequence.Length]` represents the entire range. 

The following code creates a subrange with the words "quick", "brown", and "fox". It includes `words[1]` through `words[3]`. The element `words[4]` isn't in the range. Add the following code to the same method. Copy and paste it at the bottom of the interactive window.

[!code-csharp[Range](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_Range)]

The following code creates a subrange with "lazy" and "dog". It includes `words[^2]` and `words[^1]`. The end index `words[^0]` isn't included. Add the following code as well:

[!code-csharp[LastRange](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_LastRange)]

The following examples create ranges that are open ended for the start, end, or both:

[!code-csharp[PartialRange](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_PartialRanges)]

You can also declare ranges or indices as variables. The variable can then be used inside the `[` and `]` characters:

[!code-csharp[IndexRangeTypes](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_RangeIndexTypes)]

The following sample shows many of the reasons for those choices. Modify `x`, `y`, and `z` to try different combinations. When you experiment, use values where `x` is less than `y`, and `y` is less than `z` for valid combinations. Add the following code in a new method. Try different combinations:

[!code-csharp[SemanticsExamples](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_Semantics)]

## Type support for indices and ranges

Indexes and ranges provide clear, concise syntax to access a single element or a sub-range of elements in a sequence. An index expression typically returns the type of the elements of a sequence. A range expression typically returns the same sequence type as the source sequence.

If a type provides an [indexer](../programming-guide/indexers/index.md) with an <xref:System.Index> or <xref:System.Range> parameter, it explicitly supports indices or ranges respectively. When the type provides an indexer that takes a single <xref:System.Range> parameter, it may choose to return a different sequence type, such as <xref:System.Span%601?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

A type is **countable** if it has a property named `Length` or `Count` with an accessible getter and a return type of `int`. A countable type that doesn't explicitly support indices or ranges may provide an implicit support for them. For more information, see the [Implicit Index support](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges.md#implicit-index-support) and [Implicit Range support](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges.md#implicit-range-support) sections of the [feature proposal note](~/_csharplang/proposals/csharp-8.0/ranges.md). Ranges using implicit range support return the same sequence type as the source sequence.

For example, the following .NET types support both indices and ranges: <xref:System.Array>, <xref:System.String>, <xref:System.Span%601>, and <xref:System.ReadOnlySpan%601>. The <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List%601> supports indices but doesn't support ranges.

## Scenarios for indices and ranges

You'll often use ranges and indices when you want to perform some analysis on subrange of an entire sequence. The new syntax is clearer in reading exactly what subrange is involved. The local function `MovingAverage` takes a <xref:System.Range> as its argument. The method then enumerates just that range when calculating the min, max, and average. Try the following code in your project:

[!code-csharp[MovingAverages](~/samples/csharp/tutorials/RangesIndexes/IndicesAndRanges.cs#IndicesAndRanges_MovingAverage)]
