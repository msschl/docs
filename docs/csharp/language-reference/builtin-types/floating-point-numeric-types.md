# Floating-point numeric types (C# reference)

The **floating-point types** are a subset of the **simple types** and can be initialized with [*literals*](#real-literals). All floating-point types are also value types. All floating-point numeric types support [arithmetic](../operators/arithmetic-operators.md), [comparison](../operators/comparison-operators.md), and [equality](../operators/equality-operators.md) operators.

## Characteristics of the floating-point types

C# supports the following predefined floating-point types:
  
|C# type/keyword|Approximate range|Precision|Size|.NET type|
|----------|-----------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
|`float`|±1.5 x 10<sup>−45</sup> to ±3.4 x 10<sup>38</sup>|~6-9 digits|4 bytes|<xref:System.Single?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|`double`|±5.0 × 10<sup>−324</sup> to ±1.7 × 10<sup>308</sup>|~15-17 digits|8 bytes|<xref:System.Double?displayProperty=nameWithType>|
|`decimal`|±1.0 x 10<sup>-28</sup> to ±7.9228 x 10<sup>28</sup>|28-29 digits|16 bytes|<xref:System.Decimal?displayProperty=nameWithType>|

In the preceding table, each C# type keyword from the leftmost column is an alias for the corresponding .NET type. They are interchangeable. For example, the following declarations declare variables of the same type:

```csharp
double a = 12.3;
System.Double b = 12.3;
```

The default value of each floating-point type is zero, `0`. Each of the floating-point types has the `MinValue` and `MaxValue` constants that provide the minimum and maximum finite value of that type. The `float` and `double` types also provide constants that represent not-a-number and infinity values. For example, the `double` type provides the following constants: <xref:System.Double.NaN?displayProperty=nameWithType>, <xref:System.Double.NegativeInfinity?displayProperty=nameWithType>, and <xref:System.Double.PositiveInfinity?displayProperty=nameWithType>.

Because the `decimal` type has more precision and a smaller range than both `float` and `double`, it's appropriate for financial and monetary calculations.

You can mix [integral](integral-numeric-types.md) types and floating-point types in an expression. In this case, the integral types are converted to floating-point types. The evaluation of the expression is performed according to the following rules:

- If one of the floating-point types is `double`, the expression evaluates to `double`, or to [bool](bool.md) in relational and equality comparisons.
- If there is no `double` type in the expression, the expression evaluates to `float`, or to [bool](bool.md) in relational and equality comparisons.

A floating-point expression can contain the following sets of values:

- Positive and negative zero
- Positive and negative infinity
- Not-a-Number value (NaN)
- The finite set of nonzero values

For more information about these values, see IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic, available on the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org) website.

You can use either [standard numeric format strings](../../../standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings.md) or [custom numeric format strings](../../../standard/base-types/custom-numeric-format-strings.md) to format a floating-point value.

## Real literals

The type of a real literal is determined by its suffix as follows:

- The literal without suffix or with the `d` or `D` suffix is of type `double`
- The literal with the `f` or `F` suffix is of type `float`
- The literal with the `m` or `M` suffix is of type `decimal`

The following code demonstrates an example of each:

```csharp
double d = 3D;
d = 4d;
d = 3.934_001;

float f = 3_000.5F;
f = 5.4f;

decimal myMoney = 3_000.5m;
myMoney = 400.75M;
```

The preceding example also shows the use of `_` as a *digit separator*, which is supported starting with C# 7.0. You can use the digit separator with all kinds of numeric literals.

You also can use scientific notation, that is, specify an exponent part of a real literal, as the following example shows:

```csharp-interactive
double d = 0.42e2;
Console.WriteLine(d);  // output 42;

float f = 134.45E-2f;
Console.WriteLine(f);  // output: 1.3445

decimal m = 1.5E6m;
Console.WriteLine(m);  // output: 1500000
```

## Conversions

There is only one implicit conversion between floating-point numeric types: from `float` to `double`. However, you can convert any floating-point type to any other floating-point type with the [explicit cast](../operators/type-testing-and-cast.md#cast-operator-). For more information, see [Built-in numeric conversions](numeric-conversions.md).
